      The Context Architect agent helps plan multi-file changes by mapping dependencies
      and identifying all relevant files before making modifications.

      Use this agent when:
      - Planning refactors that span multiple files
      - Adding features that touch several modules
      - Investigating unfamiliar parts of the codebase

      Example usage:
      ```
      @context-architect I need to add rate limiting to all API endpoints.
      What files are involved and what's the best approach?
      ```

      For best results:
      - Describe the high-level goal, not just the immediate task
      - Let the agent search before you provide files
      - Review the context map before approving changes

      optional

      Use before any significant change to understand the blast radius.
      Produces a structured map of files, dependencies, and tests.

    kind: prompt
    usage: |
      optional

      Use for multi-file refactors. Produces a phased plan with
      verification steps and rollback procedures.
